\- I don't understand what your point is when it comes to farms. Factory farming or small local farming doesn't change what veganism is about. I don't really understand where one would find the moral ""okayness"" in still slitting the throat of a pig, cow, or chicken in a small farm, whether they've been 'taken care of better' or not. Or impregnating a cow to get milk out of it, send the calf to slaughter, and get rid of the cow after 3 years as well by also sending it to slaughter 'cause it's not productive anymore. All in all, veganism is not a struggle against factory farming.

A lovely but unobtainable concept. Thanks human condition. 

>Basically, would you feel better eating meat if you knew that it was either obtained by the local farmer or your own (with farms being extremely small scale, possibly even just a chicken pen in your backyard)

No. Would you feel better if I kept sex slaves on a thousand acre property with no way to escape but treated really well with quite a lot of other freedoms, instead of in the basement of a suburban house? Location or owning your own doesn't really affect much when you're still violating their rights and in the case of animals, their lives. 

>hunted for in a far greater, stronger environment due to humans becoming far less spread out and pollution being cut be huge margins, by either you or your local hunter? 

If we were to cease all forms of fishing and farming only to rely on ""environmentally friendly"" hunting, the global ecology would be void of all land mammals within a month. And you'd still be unnecessarily violating their rights to bodily autonomy and freedom. 

>And also consider that in this hypothetical that there is no giant evil meat industry that will be indirectly supported by you eating ""ethically"" (for you to decide) sourced meat, due to you conforming to the concept of eating meat and helping normalise that to the people around you, even tho they'll just go get it unethically.

Ok. But what do you do once you've inevitably destroyed land based ecology in under a month? Are you going to force EVERYONE to cut their meat consumption by 90% to comply with this local, ethically sourced meat ideology that doesn't have big evil corporations to steal innocent lives for you? 

>So there's my question, how would your feelings change about meat, if at all, if we were in a communist society?

Communism is a human centric socioeconomic ideology. Functionality it's got nothing to do with veganism or carnism. Parts of the ideology, specifically the equality side of it, can harmonize with vegan ideology in the sense that we wouldn't be mistreating own kind simply because of arbitrary differences so why would mistreat others who are not like us still for arbitrary reasons. It would be safe to assume in a communist world, more people would be partial to vegan ideology for that reason but veganism in of itself is not a requirement for communism to work anymore than carnism is a requirement for capitalism. It just so happens that in a capitalist society, people tend to be more self centered and greedy and mistreatment all round seems to be the trending norm. 

>This is low key assuming that the majority of vegans are at least kinda into communism, but I'm pretty confident due to hippy overlap.

Well because things would be locally sourced and wouldn't require insane production due to people providing for themselves and their community, they wouldn't need ultra efficient farms because teaching people how to provide their own food would become far more important.

It would be less intense, but the pressure is inherent to large scale animal agriculture, it doesn't come from capitalism.

>Well because things would be locally sourced and wouldn't require insane production due to people providing for themselves and their community

This isn't how communism has worked in practice - in fact, trying to decentralize industry and make big overhauls to living style seems to be one of the big points at which a lot of communist countries failed.

>And if we assume no farms, and instead only hunting or knowing about a family of cows somewhere that you monitor and look after until the day they die?

Well again, in a month there'd be no more hunting or family of cows to monitor. Farm animals make up about 60% of land mammal biomass. Wild animals make up 4% and we artificially breed farm animals to meet demand. After a month, and satisfying the unnecessarily cruel desire for meat in one's tum tums, you'd have to go back to farming and more intensly to account for the fact that those hunting now in reality would have nothing to hunt.

Edit: if you read this I would recommend to **read this comment in its entirety** because some ideas later on would be difficult to understand otherwise.

As to your question:
I think it is definitely a difficult topic. There are a lot of hidden animal products in different day to day objects. It would be restricting your life in multiple dimensions to always keep track of animal products in things you use. Usually people focus on clothing and food because there you consume far more animal products potentially.

Wouldn't you brush your teeth, shower, use toilet paper if you forget to bring those things to your friends house and they are not vegan there?

The usual definition of veganism (which I disagree with) offers a solution to this problem with the term ""practicable"". I don't really like the term because it is quite loaded and mostly means what a person wants it to mean. A mother could say it is not practicable to cook for herself seperatly like another person says that avocados pollinated by bees are to difficult to avoid.

The last important aspect before I give my opinion is the idea of something being necessary or just for personal pleasure. You admit that you don't need it and in other ethical questions we also seperate necessity from pleasure: there is a difference between someone who steals a jacket because it looks good and someone who would freeze in the winter without it. Therefore the question isn't about necessity but about reasonable personal sacrifices someone should have to make.

But personal pleasure vs. necessity are a spectrum not a binary. If you are certain that you will survive without the jacket and will only have discomfort at night then it definitely is about pleasure in some sense. When someone steals food but technically they could buy the cheapest food and still live off it then it technically is about pleasure.

____

In my opinion it really depends on how important the bike is to you. If you think it would take something away to not have that bike then go for it.

Veganism is not a binary there are things that are more or less vegan. People here don't want to admit it but certainly practice it with the idea of ""practicability"". Where the disagreement between me and other might be is in the narrowness of veganism. I had a vegan friend who roughly once a year ate a non-vegan pizza. But he avoided non-organic bananas because they contain chitosan and I didn't and don't.

I read Diet for a New America by John Robbins and that got me over the edge. 
* **How did the transition go for you** 
* **What was the toughest part you had to overcome in the beginning**  I'll answer those together--It was rocky at first, figuring out what had dairy and eggs.  I remember going out with my sisters to an ice cream shop and I skipped the ice cream because I knew it had dairy, but I ordered a blueberry muffin.  I was halfway through the muffin before it occurred to me it probably had eggs and/or dairy too.  I had been a HUGE dairy addict and there were no good dairy substitutes back then.  The soy milk was brown and beany tasting, and there was like one vegan cheese and it was repulsive.  There were no vegan or even vegetarian restaurants in my area.  The biggest issue was other people though.  I had people waving meat in my face and constantly searching for something that they could use to call me out as a hypocrite.  
* **Which food quickly became a staple when you ran out of ideas** Tofu scramble and beans and rice. 
* **When would you say you started to ""get in the groove"" — meaning you felt secure about your lifestyle and future moving forward**  I'm not sure!  I knew from the beginning that this was what I was going to do for life, but it probably took a few months before I didn't really even have to think about it much anymore...it was just what I did.  
* **How did you deal with an unsupportive family or environment** I was extremely lucky, my family was very supportive and cool.  My mom ended up going vegan as well, and my sister went vegetarian.  Even the ones who didn't change their own diet were good about it.  After my mom died, I took over holiday meals and did them all vegan and aside from a random in-law or boyfriend who showed up, they were fine with it.  My older sister was a reporter for the local Jewish newspaper and she wrote a really nice story about my vegan passover seder.  There was a quote from my dad that as long as we were all together, that's what mattered.  He also said I was a good cook.  :)  
* **What do you know now that wish you knew sooner?**  This is more on the activism front, but I wish I'd known that these single issue agriculture campaigns are pointless.

The transition was fine, I had to throw myself into it and read lots of labels. Living in London helped as there were lots of places to go / easy to find the foods I wanted (as long as I was prepared to travel). 

Toughest part was (and is) eating out, and going abroad. Answer is I don't eat out much anymore and go abroad to places I know I can find vegan food with ease.

I was a high carb vegan for a good while (remember Durian Rider? yeah), so lots of fruit and then rice and sweet potatoes. I eat lots more protein now but still prefer a higher carb, lower fat diet. Staples now are tofu, soya chunks, rice, lentils.

nlg8mml,vegan,2025-10-26T09:29:20+00:00,"1. I had been vegetarian for a long time and known I wanted to be vegan but wasn’t sure why. Finding out more about animal conditions, the parallels between how humans exploit them and exploit each other (primarily, at the time, the parallels between the dairy industry and the patriarchy), and understanding how it fits in my vision of a more just world is what pushed me into action
2. The transition was fairly easy. I started by deciding not to buy animal products and a month later I stopped consuming them altogether. But realizing I’d been lactose intolerant this whole time and that I didn’t have to hurt like that was a blessing lmao. 
3. The toughest part was adjusting how much I needed to eat. I would get super dizzy at first and realized I wasn’t eating nearly enough because the dairy and egg products I’d been eating were so dense. Once I figured that out, I was golden
4. It took me a while to find my staple foods but first was probably fried rice with any veggies I had in the fridge, or another version of sautéing stuff with a grain or pasta. More recently it’s been more bean-centric because of my partner’s love of beans, and that’s been good for me too. Our dish when we’re exhausted is peanut noodles
5. It didn’t take me long to get in the groove but I think that’s more of a personality trait than anything. I tend to full send decisions I make and get fired up about it. If anything it took me a couple of years to mellow out and realize how much of the animal exploitation industry is systemic and that anger at non-vegan individuals is not ~~my path. More recently though I’ve been feeling more fired up again, but in a way that feels more reasonable than before, and that feels like finding a new groove. 
6. I wish I knew how to prep veggies quickly sooner. I was doing manyyyyyy pasta dishes with no veggies where I could feel that I wasn’t getting everything I needed, and learning how to get better at cooking fast was a big deal. Nowadays my goal is to meal prep, but that takes a lot of organization that I don’t currently excel at lol.

>How did the transition go for you

Easily enough. I had the monetary resources where buying vegan wasn't a strain, and I was living in a big city in a first-world country with good vegan product availability.

>Which food quickly became a staple when you ran out of ideas

Rice mixed with canned beans/vegetables, tofu, and fake meat grounds. It was simple, it was easy to make in bulk, and it was filling.

Giving up cheese. The vegan replacements, especially for straight cheese rather than cheese flavoring, are almost universally awful. 

>When would you say you started to ""get in the groove"" — meaning you felt secure about your lifestyle and future moving forward

I moved into veganism from vegetarianism, so the adjustment process was minimal - a month, maybe?

* How did the transition go for you

Very easy and simple. We cut all animal products instantly overnight, milk and eggs also just as a precaution as we looked into the topic further (watched Dominion, seeing how this topic is more of a moral imperative than a personal preference, and also how much of a sham vegetarianism is, etc.).

The grocery store has more than enough plant-based options that we've cycled through over the years, and I can't really say what had quickly became a staple.

2. For about half a year I had been trying some vegan foods because my dad went whole food plant based, and not eating much meat or animal products. After winter break with extended family had ended, on Jan 1st, I went all in.

 
3. Tbh I was recovering from an eating disorder, so making sure restricting certain food groups doesn’t mean restricting anything else.


4. Brown rice and red kidney beans with soy sauce and nutritional yeast 


5. Probably 6 months in 


6. Asserting myself and refusing to budge on my views. Avoid arguing with people who just want to antagonize me for the sake of it.


7. Some lotions, skincare products, and makeup products, are certainly not vegan or cruelty free. For some reason I didn’t make this connection at first. Also, recognize that some people may have vegan morals in theory but have not been given the push to move over yet…realize that they’re like my younger self and lead by example for them, while making them feel defensive is not productive, uplifting veganism is.

nlmrwji,vegan,2025-10-27T11:35:04+00:00,"•	⁠I was never a fan of meat. I just thought I had to eat it for protein. I’ve always had an interest in health. The first spark was watching vanlife vloggers Eamon & Bec in 2017 make easy yummy vegan dishes while on the road. I think I had a few sparks but the “last straw” was probably my mom’s death in early 2021 (aged only 72) from Alzheimer’s and my subsequent reading a couple of books on health and longevity, including Dr. Michael Greger’s How Not To Die. 

•	⁠I took it slowly. Every meal, I thought about what I could do to turn it vegan. I had already been dairy-free for over a decade because of lactose-intolerance, so that was done. It took me a few months but one day in January 2022 I realized it had been so long since I had meat that I couldn’t remember (other than salmon which I was still eating for a few more months until I learned other ways to get those omegas).

•	The only hard thing was giving up eggs because I had a nearly decade-long habit of having a veggie and scrambled egg burrito every breakfast. Feels silly now that I’m an expert at tofu scramble (and don’t even bother with kala manak because it wasn’t the flavor, just the habit). 

•	⁠I guess you could say my veggie burritos were my staple backup. I would always have tortillas, sautéed veggies and canned beans available. Also I  usually keep a couple frozen entrees on hand. I didn’t run out of ideas though because I found Rainbow Plant Life, Pick Up Limes, and other vegan chefs online generously sharing their yummy recipes. 

•	I guess I was in a groove and feeling confident about a year after I stopped making mistakes like ‘oh, there’s egg in this bread’ which was in 2023 sometime

•	I learned not to talk about it with my child who already has food allergy restrictions and feels overwhelmed by things. I am being patient with my husband too because I can’t expect someone to quickly change a 55 year habit they haven’t studied about themself when I took a few years myself. I haven’t had any push back anywhere else, except for vegans on Facebook being rude to me and others asking questions trying to learn. I’m finding vegan Reddit much friendlier. ❤️

•	I used to scoff at the repeated saying “My only regret is that I didn’t start sooner” because I generally don’t put down my past self (water under the bridge, we do the best we can, etc) but I do acknowledge that if I had been vegan before I had kids then they would be better off. I wish I could have gifted them with a plant based childhood. 

I want to add that I guess my answer might sound like I’m not in it for the animals, and it’s true they weren’t my first reason, but in addition to the vegan chefs I watch, I also watch people like Earthling Ed, Mic The Vegan, Natalie Fulton, and other vegan activists, so while I may not be vegan enough for some (I might buy wool socks) I am learning and very agreeable with the idea of a vegan world.",1,t3_1ogfbl1,t3_1ogfbl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1ogfbl1/what_were_your_early_vegan_days_like/nlmrwji/,Mixed,What were your early vegan days like?,0.994,positive,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,Barrier-dominated (PBC),False

Animal and environmental protection are only ""woke"" concepts to schizoid right-wingers who think Impossible and Beyond Meat is funded by Jeff Bezos and the green agenda. Taking those peoples bad faith states of mental psychosis as serious points of introspection is an insult to human cognition.

its not an issue of ""wokeness"", I agree the people who care (or even keep up) with identity slop in the U.S are a pitifully small fraction of the consumer base but the AR and environmetal arguments have proven to be insufficient to break the 10% market share these products already occupy in the meat sector. I think the more novel argument the PB sector brought was the ""tech"" argument as that is something I can't recall any product making and it will certainly be used, if not assigned, to CM once it hits the market B2C in a meaningful capacity. I think the tech argument is good in any context that is not B2C because the strong tech arguments you can give such as sustainablility, price, similarity, allergen/dietary restriction arguments are all metrics that orgs care about much more than consumers.

""Flexitarian"" is not an identity nor an actual consumer base. That's just being an omnivore with extra steps. No one is going to buy a plant-based burger that's half beef.

I would say the problem with ""flexitarian"" as a target is in the name, they are too flexible and unreliable to base a CPG food company on. The category already deals with roughly 1263891267 sources of instability and companies live and die based on reliability in the space, adding a unreliable customer base that may or may not consume your product is asking for trouble. I agree with the sentiments regarding the blend shit, nobody wants half soy half animal milk nobody wants a half iphone half pixel phone nobody wants a half tobacco half vape is there any CPG product that has done this and succeed? Beyond is way more innovative with their whole vegetable meat subs that is much more inline with what the consumer is asking for

The fact that the CEO of one of the largest plant-based meat firms in the space - whose products have some of the most promising profiles - is saying this much fundamentally dumb shit is why Oatly remains on top. They actually double down on aggressive marketing by making fun of milk producers. Their leadership doesn't let anti-consumers who hate their product for ideological reasons control their time and attention.

No I had disagree. Not on the lobbying but on incorpoarating political action as a business strategy. What the PB companies need is what Cargill's got, what Tyson's got which is consistency and reliability. Relying on gov wins especially in a crowded, politicized, identitatian space like the US is at right now is unreliable. I'm very jealous of the space Cargill and Tyson occupy in the military. Those contracts give them exactly what the alt protein sector needs with none of the PR comms issues. And if you've been following the mercy of animals work on this front nearly 81% of military base staff they they want PB food and 51% military wide say they want PB food. That is a space that I would prefer to be occupied by MA actors.

The plant-based meat market consumer profile are high-income, college educated, young, females, vegan/vegetarian, in Democrat or Purple States/metropolitan areas. That's the most frequent and brand loyal consumers.

Yeah I meant vegan consumers. That study was about the effectiveness of Impossible Foods advertising campaign. All it demonstrates is that advertising and marketing campaigns in the sector do more to capture market share inside the category rather than capturing other meat categories. To capture any significant amount of the beef, pork, or poultry sector would require an incredibly intensive advertisement campaign which is forthcoming. Trying to turnover flexetarians or Republicans and Independents wouldn't produce the results the CEO is attempting.

>Relying on gov wins especially in a crowded, politicized, identitatian space like the US is at right now is unreliable. 

One of the things the former study demonstrates is that higher prices on meat products induces higher probability consumption of plant-based alternatives. The type of change the plant-based meat category needs is to induce political change and pour money into Prop 12 type amendments to rise the price of their competitors who are largely competitive purely because they don't have to price in animal welfare. Plant-based meat just needs to centralize money into a political lobby/trade association.



>I'm very jealous of the space Cargill and Tyson occupy in the military. Those contracts give them exactly what the alt protein sector needs with none of the PR comms issues.

That's the most frequent and brand loyal consumers. That's not to say you can't try and capture the Flexetarian or Health-conscious consumers, but that consumer composition largely means that Impossible and Beyond benefit more from turning out the ethical vegan/vegetarian consumers than converting flexetarians or pescatarians. ""

I think the B2B approach is the only feasible one given this pigeonholing. I wish PB and alt meat weren't so associated with veganism, veganism has so much negative PR it's dragging down industries that are only associated with it. Better to have the customer not even get a choice with what they are eating like with Eric Adam's NY hospital. That has to be the most successful implementation of a PB food system i have seen so far. gives consistency and reliablilty too. I'd target hospitals, retirement homes, work event venues, around the coasts. I really want to get away from the consumer sentient space as far as i can. Another thing I am jealous of is Cargill's PR. When you don't have a PR it's very easy to make changes in politically sensitive topics like food culture.

""Yeah I meant vegan consumers. That study was about the effectiveness of Impossible Foods advertising campaign. All it demonstrates is that advertising and marketing campaigns in the sector do more to capture market share inside the category rather than capturing other meat categories. To capture any significant amount of the beef, pork, or poultry sector would require an incredibly intensive advertisement campaign which is forthcoming. Trying to turnover flexetarians or Republicans and Independents wouldn't produce the results the CEO is attempting. ""

I agree and it's actually deeper I think the concept of ""turningover"" the customer is so antiquated like the customer is going to break their identity for a product? I think you'd need a politcal revolution for that to be plausible becasue as it is now the american consumer mindset cannot comprehend ""persuade"", ""convince"", or ""convert"", or ""compromise"" (as we will soon see with the failure of animal-plant blends). I sure hope when the CM-PB blends are ready the companies will wait for bernie and trump to die before they release it in the US and Europe.

Ya and I'm not contending the assessment but the PB companies don't have the resources bc they don't have the consistency to get the product out to make a sale to the customer base they already have. What money is there to centralize?

Also, there are vegans who are devout Christians as well. You clearly aren’t aware of the Christian arguments in favor of not consuming animal bodyparts. To start, you can look up the devout Christian and vegetarian author Leo Tolstoy’s paper called “The First Step”, where he advocates for not consuming animal bodyparts. 

To be more direct, as someone who has read the entirety of the Bible, in the New Testament, St. Paul states two rules for animal consumption - that the animal should be strangulated to death nor should you consume animal blood, since blood is life. 

Now, as I’m sure you know, meat is an animal’s flesh, and there’s animal blood in small amounts even after drainage of the blood. So animal eaters are still consuming animal’s blood every time they eat an animal’s flesh. Vegans consume considerably less animal’s blood than carnists do, therefore, we live more according to that principle than you guys do. 

Also, can you justifiably say why strangulation is unethical and against being Christian, but on the same hand, gas chamber suffocations are justified, along with putting animals on a conveyor belt hanging upside down by their feet? Vegans live better by the principle of not consuming any strangulated animal bodypart, since we don’t eat animal bodyparts. 

Also, humanity was closest to god in the Bible and in a sinless state in the Garden of Eden, where we ate a plant based diet. It’s only after sin enters the world that animal consumption enters the world as well, meaning sin and animal consumption are associated together within the Bible. 

Also, there are devout Christian sects that are vegetarian and against animal consumption, such as the seventh day Adventists. 

You need to do more reading - of the Bible, of Christianity, of conservativism, and of veganism. ",1,t1_nlgamaj,t3_1ofw4l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1ofw4l3/peter_mcguinness_referred_to_the_original/nli4kx4/,Mixed,"Peter McGuinness referred to the original marketing of Impossible Foods’ plant-based meat products as a solution to the climate crisis as a “mistake,” and called the original leaders “zealots.” He added, “People don’t want to eat tech food or climate food.”",0.8271,positive,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,True,Barrier-dominated (PBC),False

Consuming some blood is no different from a vegan that still causes the deaths of some animals with their diet. 

Faith in Christ is what makes someone a Christian. His word, His way, and that does not include the idea that it is immoral to eat meat.

I, for myself, think that animal consumption is the work of Satan, and any place where animal consumption is condoned in the Bible is Satanic. I don’t consider the entirety of the Bible to be holy, only parts of it. Satan and evil abounds throughout the text. 

God, if God is to be both all knowing and all good, would not have us harm defenseless sentient beings when we don’t have to. Why would he create creatures that can feel pain, that scream out in utter agony when they’re being slaughtered, in order for humans to then ignore all basic sense of empathy and compassion and to continue our abuse of them, as opposed to eating plants?

I have a more positive conception of God than you likely do, if you think God supports Satanic activity like gas chamber suffocations of defenseless sentient beings, because you think bacon or a hamburger is tastier than tofu.

I live at home with an aging parent whom I’m taking care of, and I’ve been vegan for awhile. I cook for both of us as well and I make sure her meals are nutritionally balanced while adding supplements where there are gaps for her. After exposing her to vegan home cooking for awhile I had her watch as much of the Dominion documentary they could. Also with some talking after that I really think that helped them get on board emotionally. There are also times where I’m tired from work and she doesn’t want to eat the food in the fridge so she orders online, but the compromise we made was she orders from fully vegan restaurants. (Non vegan restaurants are too complicated for her to read through the menu and see what’s vegan or not.) if it’s possible maybe you can give him a list of vegan premade food brands, and vegan alternatives to his favorites, then also a list of vegan friendly restaurants. For my mom I found vegan replacements for all of her favorite foods or learned how to cook them so she wouldn’t have to change too much. I will say on the occasion when she does go outside on her own for a walk she will come back home with non vegan food from the corner store. But her impact is so much smaller now. I basically made it as uber convenient and tasty as I could which was easier for her to transition so she really had no excuse lol.      
But I’m also not a health food vegan at all, I always add a little extra vegan butter in my stir fry, more olive oil in the dressing for her salads, I fry oyster mushrooms a lot, and we order from a vegan bakery often. Her health was so bad before I moved in so even though it’s not the best it’s still a drastic improvement in lowering her cholesterol.
I think it’s harder to transition from junk food omnivore to extremely healthy vegan which could be part of the problem for him.

Whereas with fossil fuels, our modern civilisation currently depends on trains, global shipping, airplanes, tractors, trucks, electricity, synthetic fertiliser, polyester, etc. and to replace them we need to invent new technologies and weigh up their respective environmental impacts. It is not as easy as it sounds, and will take time. Consider that before industrial revolution, our civilisation was wholly dependent of domesticated animals (for transport, farm work, fertiliser, military, textiles, etc.) and it is only thanks to fossil fuels that we have alternatives to an animal-based economy.

Basically, by going vegan now, we can buy ourselves more time to strategically wean our civilisation off of fossil fuels. It is a propaganda tactic that anti-vegan Luddites use to equate the impact of fossil fuels with animal agriculture. This is a way to undermine vegans because, e.g. in a cold climate the vegan may wear synthetic insulation, and the anti-vegan environmentalist will say that insulation made from fossil fuels is worse than wool or down or fur. Likewise, anti-vegan environmentalists favour ""regenerative agriculture"" that uses manure and blood+bone as inputs versus synthetic fertilisers (that are currently made from natural gas).

In a completely rational world an environmental activist motivated exclusively by climate concerns would advocate for the regulation of both since neither is in principle incompatible with a carbon-neutral economy.

In our world, such an environmental activist is probably better off calling for the elimination for fossil fuels as that is a far more compelling rallying cry than calling for its regulation. They're also better off centering fossil fuels in their activism as fossil fuels are both far more polluting and simultaneously more demand elastic than animal products, whereas calls for the elimination or even merely the reduction of meat consumption will lead to many if not most people being turned off entirely.

Climate change activists do not make excuses for coal mining or oil rigging, even though these industries do provide something useful for human civilisation. Whereas livestock farmers provide \*nothing\* of value to modern human civilisation, yet climate activists who consume meat and dairy cannot realise this because they are too attached and besotted by cheese, steak, leather, etc. that they invariably make the same stupid excuses that non-vegans make, e.g. romanticising small, local farms, appealing to tradition, etc.

Ultimately, I think a non-vegan stance makes them compromised as environmentalists because when they meet and lobby politicians what are they asking for? Will they campaign to end government farming subsidies, even though that will put the small ""ethical"" livestock farms they patronage out of business? I don't think so. I think non-vegan environmentalists use their influence and political capital to get politicians to make crowd-pleasing promises about ""net-zero"" and appease their meat-addicted constituency that they will always have access to ""high-quality"", ""ethical"" animal-products. This is basically the status quo and pretty much guarantees that the masses will keep eating as much meat as they do because they are led to believe solar panel and windmills will stop climate change. Meanwhile, the deforestation will continue to drive wildlife to extinction.

In my opinion, the only way to get the masses to reduce their meat consumption is to stop romanticising animal products and to make meat exorbitantly expensive by stopping all farming subsidies.

It makes sense that climate activists are for the elimination of fossil fuels, as fossil fuels are the direct cause of the climate crisis. A world without fossil fuels could still have some amount of animal agriculture without damaging the climate. I find it strange that you don't think climate activists are portrayed as extremists because they certainly are, at least here in the US.

> Whereas livestock farmers provide *nothing* of value to modern human civilisation

People get personal satisfaction out of eating meat because they enjoy the taste. That is valuable to some people. Just like one might enjoy unnecessary activities like video games, art, outdoor activities, travel, etc. Yes, we vegans find eating meat to be particularly abhorrent because it requires the exploitation of a sentient being, but that has nothing to do with the climate. From a climate perspective there's no difference between eating meat for the taste and flying all over the world for leisure. In fact, for frequent travelers, the latter is worse.

> Will they campaign to end government farming subsidies, even though that will put the small ""ethical"" livestock farms they patronage out of business?

They have relatively higher carbon footprints, yes, but you're overestimating the impact occasional consumption can have on the footprint of an entire diet.

As I understand, the direct cause of climate change are greenhouse gasses. If we are saying that fossil fuels is a direct cause of climate change, then we must categorise livestock as a direct cause. Actually the gasses emitted by livestock (methane) is worse for climate change than the gasses emitted by burning coal (carbon dioxide).

I would also note that it is not only climate change, but also the loss of natural habitat and hence biodiversity that is a serious environmental problem. In terms of land use, livestock are far worse than fossil fuels.

The main problem with fossil fuels is that they made human civilisation ridiculously efficient. Whereas in the past we struggled to sustain a human population 1 billion using animal (and slave) labour, thanks to the industrial revolution we can have a human population 8+ billion and an order of magnitude more livestock.

If the message that climate activists were advocating was ""moderation"", then I would not chastise them for not being vegan. What I am criticising is taking an abolitionist stance against fossil fuels whilst being moderate against animal agriculture.

Is there an ecological function that domesticated animals perform better the feral animals of the same species?

I understand the nuance is in the economics, because private citizens/companies cannot afford to keep bare land with feral pigs or horses. I also understand that until native predators are reintroduced, hunting is necessary for habitat conservation. So at least in the short term, I am more against livestock farming than hunting (although in the future I hope people stop hunting too).

That is why, ultimately, rewilding needs to be done by government who can seize land to set up wildlife corridors, etc.

I am not downplaying the work you do -- I respect it, and understand you would have to make compromises with livestock farmers since their properties are probably adjacent to the land you are working with.

>Wolves here in Europe can co-exist with animal farming, and do now, as they are already re-colonising.

But wouldn't the wolf population be healthier (i.e. more diverse and numerous) without animal farming, if the land was left alone with feral sheep and feral pigs? That is my point, animal farming comes at a cost to native ecology, and the ""benefits"" that animal farming provides human civilisation in the 21st century (and looking forward to the 22nd century) is trivial since in an industrialised economy, crops are grown with synthetic fertiliser, and transportation, ploughing, milling is done with mechanical or electrical machines.

I mean, I concur that vegetarian kinda implies vegetables only, but they still define themselves like that and I've never seen another ""full"" vegetarian complain about it, so I don't know.

Ah, for the grill is not a problem, they're chill about it, they don't want to eat the meat, but it's fine cooking on the same grill (not that I could do otherwise anyway, but still). It's more like they don't want to buy and consume meat, if they're cooked together (not side by side clearly, but the grill should be large enough to keep them separate) it's fine by them.

I ask because I want to cook something nice for them, if I ask them they'll go ""Don't worry, I'll get something myself"" because they don't want to bother people they're invited to. I've got other non-vegetarian friends being like that too about some other kind of foods too, like ""Nooo, don't worry, don't cook something specifically for me, I'll eat something else on the table but that dish"", but it doesn't bother me, I like to cook, I'll cook something for you even if this was carbonara day and you don't like carbonara (my father also does that for me when it's fish dinner, since I don't like fish).

n3uimfj,vegetarian,2025-07-18T16:59:31+00:00,"I live in Boston and would say almond and soy are comparable in prices everywhere I go. Most coffee shops have several options including soy, oat, almond, and sometimes more but they are generally a .75 upcharge. 

I was vegan in 2011 and I also recall the downfall of soy. It used to be the main choice available(if not the only choice) but then was replaced very aggressively by almond. From my perspective at the time it was related to the estrogen controversy. I think dairy companies did a very good job scaring people off soy for a long time.

ETA: I also think oat replaces dairy in things like coffee a bit better than other options, so it became popular among the lactose intolerant population. Most alt milks have an aftertaste.

The hard part about vegetarianism is getting the right nutrition profile in your diet and this book will tell you literally everything you need to know. It's all you need. There is an express edition but I would recommend picking up the comprehensive.


As for nutrition the following is mostly what you need to focus on. Once I accounted for all this in my diet things steadied out:


- protein
- healthy fat
- fiber
- iron
- B12
- zinc
- selenium


Legumes, nuts, lentils, and seeds are essential. Brazil Nuts for Selenium (but more than 4 per day is toxic). Protein is actually the easiest part but you do need to focus on it and get enough. Generally two big servings of protein per day as well as other nutrient dense foods will do the trick. Fortified soy milk is great for B12.",3,t3_1lwmhts,t3_1lwmhts,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1lwmhts/recommendations_for_social_media_accounts/n2fyduw/,Plant-based,"Recommendations for social media accounts, podcasts, etc.",0.9656,positive,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,Attitude-dominated,False

Cooking at high heat reduces the amount of oil absorbed by food. When the oil is hot before food is put into the pan, less is absorbed. This is because there's enough heat to quickly get the moisture at the surface of the food above the steam point. The moisture evaporating from the food creates pressure, which repels oil from the food's surface and reduces further absorption. 

The reason some food is greasy is that it was cooked at too low a temperature. 

 Crisco-brand shortening once had an ad campaign that demonstrated this point. It showed a pan of fried chicken being tipped to drain off the fat, with the proclamation, ""All but two tablespoons returns to the cup!""

It would make sense that if our ancestor bacteria evolved in only “pre-chicken soup mix 236” , then we should naturally BEST digest “pre-chicken soup mix 236”.

Being able to mostly digest pretty much everything else is a bonus…

(Plus bacteria “fucked” other bacteria (F-pilli, plasmids, transposons), we evolved further and our ancestors traveled over ice bridges and procreated outside their tribes.)

But, if a person is actually SUPER UNHEALTHY/UNLUCKY, then go back to eating only “pre-chicken soup mix 236”…

And this actually turns out to be correct!!! In medical school pediatric rotation, we actually had to taste all the different baby formulas, including elemental element mixtures that lacked certain amino acids or vitamins because certain babies cannot digest them. They’re called “inborn errors of metabolism” and parents with children who are afflicted with these disorders have to be extremely careful about what their kids eat. Else the early path elements will build up in the brain and cells and cause problems.

So to answer your question, 99.9% of the time humans have evolved to be good enough to eat pretty much anything, but you are correct that there is sometimes (rarely) something that forces what’s basically your concept to be true.

Should we be avoiding “fusion diets” if our genome isn’t made from the fusion of those ancestors diets? Nah, I’m jewish (well, jew-ish, (culturally only, not religious)) and love Chinese food. Especially because that’s the only things that’s open on Christmas.

The new leader of the Conservative Party (a party which in general accepts the consensus view and actively helped invest in offshore wind energy) is now led by a walking talking Facebook meme who talks about ""net zero zealots"" and spreads misinformation about how investing in renewable energy is a waste of money and results in more expensive energy bills for the consumer.

nka6fwm,Futurology,2025-10-19T09:43:42+00:00,"The first problem with this view is short-termism that conveniently ignores that many resources are finite. Fiddling with the allocation of finite materials doesn't magically give us an infinite supply of those materials. One example: Modern society depends on rare earth materials, many of which have horizons in the decades based on identified reserves and current extraction, which is generally accelerating.

The second problem is the idea of 'fairness'. People in the wealthy world seem to think the 'hoarders' are a small group of super-wealthy. But take farmland for example. If everyone in the world was to eat meat like the average American, or even the average European, we wouldn't have enough arable land on the planet to grow the feed for the animals never mind raising the animals themselves. There are similar problems with fish stocks, fresh water, etc. In these cases, fairness doesn't mean raising the rest of the world up, it means cutting in the rich world, which in practice means pricing out the poor. A lower global population would make fairness easier to achieve in theory but thats another story

The third problem is that pace. We need time to adapt our human systems and avoid the crises created by our footprint on Earth. The more people are active on the surface of the planet, the faster the problems arise, the less time we have to react and the more overlapping crises exacerbate one another. We are changing the climate, altering biodiversity, scattering microplastics into every natural system in the biosphere. Resource allocation cannot solve those problems!

The fact is, the idea that ""We have more than enough to sustain the world"" is wilfully ignorant, naive at best. We don't, and we can't allocate our way out of these challenges.

The very wealthy don’t care how much the lawn costs as much as they want the workers near the house supervised.  Same thing with car detailing; they want a very good job regardless, but the detailer better provide a suitable high class loaner car (which really means citizen workers).  Where migrants come into play for the wealthy is usually subcontractors down the food chain (the 1980s US had a super-charged anti-migrant environment as well, with exposé’s that candidates hired an undocumented maid).

Tactically it will “balance” overtime as AI (plus automation) gets rid of more jobs and the dejected citizenry will need to man those, say, sit-down restaurant jobs, labor intensive jobs (warehouses, roofing, etc..).   Chef will keep the restaurant crew in line despite the salty talk.   Strategically the developed countries will need to import poverty (if not migrant workers then cheap goods made in factories.  I suspect good specific tariffs will abate on stuff westerners can’t really do well on the cheap .. like sewing casual clothing (minus automation in these spaces).  

Probably a demand drop, just to add, as migrants are consumers.

Also the same AI will empower emerging/frontier markets with many having coastlines for their data center cooling needs.   So the cost of running a ~~sweatshop~~ textile employment center for associates goes down while increasing customers (AI reducing language barriers). 

In terms of security, privacy rights are strong inside American and other developed country dwellings, but once outside/even inside being seen from outside, they dwindle real quick.

Can have something quant like an electronics-free reading room or martial arts dojo/yoga studio = that’s 1 out of a 100 .. not significant.

More than 11 million tons of meat is consumed in U.S. cities annually -- equating to about 329 million tons of carbon emissions, according to a study published Monday in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change.


That figure is comparable to emission levels from domestic fossil fuel combustion in the U.S., at about 334 million tons annually, Benjamin P. Goldstein, an assistant professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan and lead author of the paper, told ABC News. In addition, emissions from meat consumption in the U.S. exceed total annual carbon emissions from the U.K., at 305 million tons, and Italy, at 313 million tons, the researchers said.


The three most populated cities in the U.S. -- New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago -- consumed a total of 3.2 million tons of meat per year, according to the paper.

well it depends. factory farming is done to for effeciency right? maximize outputs and minimize inputs. 

i dont think its a settled fact that in a world where factory farming was banned, the meat industry would emit less carbon. if the same amount of meat was still being produced, maybe more carbon would be emitted. on the other hand, prices would probably go up, reducing demand, and maybe the net result would be less carbon.

It converts back to CO2 chemically over time. See the extinct great bison herds of the midwest released about as much methane as cow farming does. even the methane scare doesn't really hold up. 

The total amount of CO2 equivalents is tiny compared to power production and mobility. It's about 6% while power and mobility make up about 75%. So why even bother about the 6%? let's first half the 75%. and then maybe we can worry about it.

nlchnjh,science,2025-10-25T18:01:13+00:00,"Beef does sit at the top for GHGs and resource use per serving - no serious dataset says otherwise. But two things can be true at once:

1. **Ruminant beef is emissions-heavy.**
2. **Modern crop farming isn’t automatically “better in every way.”** A lot of it is mining soil and pushing problems off-farm.

Receipts from global soil data:

* ~**40% of land is degraded** (nutrient imbalance/depletion, erosion, salinity, etc.).
* Under conventional tillage, **erosion runs ~10–100× faster** than natural soil formation - hard to “eat plants to save soil” if we’re losing the topsoil that grows them.
* In low-input regions (e.g., parts of sub-Saharan Africa) fields **export 30–60 kg NPK/ha/yr more than they get back** - classic nutrient mining and yield stagnation.
* Agriculture has pulled **~100+ Pg of carbon** out of soils historically, cutting fertility and water-holding capacity.
* Irrigation mismanagement is **expanding salt-affected soils**, throttling productivity on prime irrigated acres.

So the question isn’t “plants vs. beef = good vs. bad.” It’s **how** each is produced and where.

**What actually helps:**

* For crops: balanced, site-specific nutrients (not just N), return of organic matter (manure/compost/residues), cover crops, reduced/no-till, and erosion/water control.
* For livestock: less feedlot grain beef, **more grazing on land that can’t grow human-edible crops**, manure back to fields, and using animals to close nutrient loops in mixed systems.

**Practical stance:** Most calories from plants grown in soil-building systems, far less high-impact beef (especially tied to deforestation), and keep ruminants where they *upcycle* grass/byproducts and help cycle nutrients. That’s not beef propaganda - it’s acknowledging that **nutrient cycles and soil health** decide whether “plant-based” actually scales sustainably.",7,t1_nlcdchv,t3_1oftxf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1oftxf2/the_meat_consumed_in_us_cities_creates_the/nlchnjh/,Mixed,The meat consumed in U.S. cities creates the equivalent of 363 million tons (329 million metric tons) of carbon emissions per year.

That’s like answering “our housing market is driven by advertising and policy” with “houses existed before marketing.”

It’s technically true but irrelevant… it shifts the argument from cause of behavior to existence of the thing itself. False equivalent. 

That’s not the comparison I made. I’m talking about why and how we eat the way we do, not whether meat existed before ads.

The point wasn’t that marketing invented food, it’s that our choices, portions, and perceptions of what’s “normal” to eat are shaped by marketing, subsidies, and policy.
